> /ultrathink:ultrathink is running… I'd like you to find out if there's a way to persist the models/requests/configuration and everything else the LiteLLM Proxy
 stores in a DB from the python SDK. My main goal is to use proxy as a read-only UI for the data persisted by the SDK running as another instance 

⏺ I'll coordinate a comprehensive investigation into whether the LiteLLM Python SDK can persist data to a database that the Proxy can read. Let me
  orchestrate this through specialized sub-agents.

  🎯 Coordinator Analysis

  Goal: Determine if the SDK can write to the same database that the Proxy reads from, enabling a read-only Proxy UI for SDK-persisted data.

  Key Questions:
  1. What data does the Proxy persist? (models, requests, config, keys, etc.)
  2. Does the SDK have database persistence capabilities?
  3. What's the database schema and ORM layer?
  4. Can we share a database between SDK and Proxy instances?
